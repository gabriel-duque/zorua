a simple Go client to update dynamic DNS synthetic records for Google Domains

## Building

In order to build `zorua` you can just:

```
    $ cd cmd/zorua 
    $ go build
```

This will produce an executable file called `zorua` which you can run directly.

## Usage

```
Usage of ./zorua:
  -config string
    	path to the JSON configuration file (default "/etc/zorua/config.json")
```

The configuration file is a simple JSON-serialized file which should look like this:

The Username and Password entries are the ones generated by Google Domains when
you create your [synthetic record for dynamic DNS](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6147083?hl=en).

```
{
  "Domain": "test.example.com",
  "Credentials": {
    "Username": "TestUsername",
    "Password": "TestPassword"
  }
}
```

## Docker

In order to ease the installation of `zorua` in cloud native environments, you
can use the provided Docker image.

This tiny image is built nightly to pull in updates to the `golang` Docker
image and is a multi-architecture image working for the following
architectures:

* x86
* x86_64
* armv6
* armv7
* armv8 (aarch64)

```
    $ docker run -v /path/to/zorua-config.json:/etc/zorua/config.json:ro zuh0/zorua
